# seq2seq
Industrial-grade implementation of seq2seq algorithm based on Pytorch, integrated beam search algorithm.

seq2seq is based on other excellent open source projects, this project has the following highlights:
1. easy to train, predict and deploy;
2. lightweight implementation;
3. multitasking support (including dialogue generation and machine translation).



## Model description

* Encoder: Bidirectional GRU
* Decoder: GRU with Attention Mechanism
* Bahdanau Attention: [Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473)
* Luong Attention: [Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
* Diversity Promoting Beam Search: [A Simple, Fast Diverse Decoding Algorithm for Neural Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.08562)



## Install

seq2seq is dependent on PyTorch. Two ways to install:

**Install seq2seq from Pypi:**

```
pip install seq2seq-pytorch
```



**Install seq2seq from the Github source:**

```
git clone https://github.com/Chiang97912/seq2seq.git
cd seq2seq
python setup.py install
```



## Usage

### Train

```python
from seq2seq.model import Seq2Seq

sources = ['...']
targets = ['...']
model = Seq2Seq('seq2seq-model', embed_size=256, hidden_size=512, lang4src='en', lang4tgt='en', device='cuda:0')
model.fit(sources, targets, epochs=20, batch_size=64)
```



### Test

```python
from seq2seq.model import Seq2Seq

model = Seq2Seq('seq2seq-model')
outputs = model.generate('...', beam_size=3, method='greedy')
print(outputs)
```
